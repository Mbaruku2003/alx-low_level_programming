t manipulation involves the changing of a number from binary to decimal and vice versa
it uses operators like:

<<left 
>> right shift
& bitwise and
| bitwise or
^ bitwise Xor
for and it checks wheather the binary for the numbers wheather both are equal to one
for | or operator, it checks wheather either of the binaries is one , or for any of their numbers or one of them is one
^ XOR operator checks wheather two bits are the same or not, if the bits are the same then the result is zero else the result is zero
! bitwise not is used to check wheather change the sign for example if the number had a bit of zero it would give a one

to change a number to a hexadeimal, we use number / 16
in binary, the numbers 10 to i6 mean a number raised to 16 times a power
