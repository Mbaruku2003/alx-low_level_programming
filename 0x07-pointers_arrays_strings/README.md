a pointer to a pointer is a pointer that stores the address of another pointer
a multidimensional array is declared as array_type array_name [x][y]
nb we always start with index zero at x and y
we access the address with the name then the two indexes.
we initialise the array as int a[x][y] = {{0,1,2,3,4},{4,5,6,7},{8,9,10,11}}
