singly linked lists contain a node which stores a value and a pointer to thr next data in the data stracture
singly linked lists have a head whose value is NULL and main importance is the address it points to which contains a structure copy of the original struct
singly linked listspoint to variable nodes and note only the head for this reason, there needs to be a way to contain the nodes
each node i)points to the next node
	  ii)containsa copy of the stracture
	  iii)can be accesed the value stored in it
	  iv)has to have a pointer that points to its location in memory from whichis the previous nodes link pointer
   	  v)has to have a piece of memory allocated to it through malloc
