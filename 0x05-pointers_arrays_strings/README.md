this is a file on arrays and pointers.
a pointer is a special type of variable that stores the adress of another variable.
the pointer using* can show value of the variable.
to show adress of variable we are pointing to we use %p in printf.
a pointer can be increased value using ++ operator
it can also be decremented using a -- operator
for strings, a '\0' a null operator is added at the end.
a pointer also gives the adress of the first adress of an array.
the derefferencing operator (*) is used to assign a new value to a variable
this is the real power of pointers , derefferencing
thre syntax for(i = 0; s[i] != '\0'; s++) is used to show the contents of an array 
excluding the '\0'
s[i] is the value being stored at pointers with i the index
the i++ is used to increment the for loop index number
in reversing a string, we use length - 1,this is because we want to find last digit
the for loop can be used to make a line or string move backward 
for e.g
for(i = l - 19when searchi to be at last digit
